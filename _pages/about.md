Hi! I am a PhD candidate at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu) working under the advisement of [Dr. Margaret Beck](https://www.bu.edu/math/profile/margaret-beck/). My research focuses on nonlinear dynamics and computer assisted proofs. 

In the last couple of years, I have become more interested in machine learning and data science. I have since worked as a research assistant studying a functional data analysis approach to machine learning and completed a data science internship at [Dyno Therapeutics](https://www.dynotx.com)

Originally from Snohomish, Washington, I completed my B.A. in Mathematics with High Honors at [Oberlin College](https://www.oberlin.edu) in 2018.
