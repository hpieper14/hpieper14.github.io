Hi! I am a PhD candidate at Boston University working under the advisement of Dr. Margaret Beck. My research focuses on nonlinear dynamics and more particularly, the long term behavior of solutions to a partial differential equation. In the last couple of years, I have become more interested in machine learning and data science. I have since worked as a research assistant studying the effects of limited data on a particular functional data analysis approach to machine learning, completed a data science bootcamp and have an upcoming data science internship in the R&D department of a biotech company.

Originally from Snohomish, Washington, I completed my B.A. in Mathematics with High Honors at Oberlin College in 2018.
