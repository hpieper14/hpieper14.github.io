## Data Science Projects 
### ClassifyMyMeds: Predicting Prior Authorization Approval and Volume for CoverMyMeds
(Project Repository)[https://github.com/hpieper14/classifymymeds]
This project was sponsored by (CoverMyMeds)[https://www.covermymeds.com] and was completed as a capstone project for (The Erdos Institute)[https://www.erdosinstitute.org]. 

When a patient tries to get a prescription from a pharmacy, a claim is created against the patient's insurance (payer). Such a pharmacy claim might be rejected for various reasons and might require prior authorization (PA). A PA is a form that providers submit on behalf of a patient to the insurance making a case for the prescribed therapy. In this project, we surveyed many classifiers for predicting how likely a certain PA will be approved, and forecast future volume of PAs with time series analysis techniques. Additionally, we identify the formulary for each payer and predict the number of times certain drugs can be refilled.

Tools used: classification, time series forecasting, uncertainty quantification

### Solving PDEs Via Deep Neural Nets 
(Project Repository)[https://github.com/hpieper14/PDEandNN]

This project uses deep neural networks to solve and identify the Swift-Hohenberg equation; a fourth order stiff partial differential equation. We review two deep learning models that concern the dynamics underlying sparse and/or noisy spatiotemporal data appearing in the above papers. The first model aims to infer the solution to a known partial differential equation from space and time data. The second model aims to identify the PDE itself. We apply these models to the 1-dimensional Swift-Hohenberg equation, which has not appeared in associated literature.

Tools used: deep learning
