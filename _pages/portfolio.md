## Data Science Projects 
### ClassifyMyMeds: Predicting Prior Authorization Approval and Volume for CoverMyMeds
[Project Repository](https://github.com/hpieper14/classifymymeds)  <br />
This project was sponsored by [CoverMyMeds](https://www.covermymeds.com) and was completed as a capstone project for [The Erdos Institute](https://www.erdosinstitute.org). 

In this project, we surveyed many classifiers for predicting how likely a certain prior authorization (PA) claim will be approved, and forecast future volume of PA claimss with time series analysis techniques. 

Tools used: classification, time series forecasting, uncertainty quantification

### Solving PDEs Via Deep Neural Nets 
[Project Repository](https://github.com/hpieper14/PDEandNN)

This project uses deep neural networks to solve and identify the Swift-Hohenberg equation; a fourth order stiff partial differential equation. We review two deep learning models that concern the dynamics underlying sparse and/or noisy spatiotemporal data appearing in the above papers. The first model aims to infer the solution to a known partial differential equation from space and time data. The second model aims to identify the PDE itself. We apply these models to the 1-dimensional Swift-Hohenberg equation, which has not appeared in associated literature.

Tools used: deep learning
