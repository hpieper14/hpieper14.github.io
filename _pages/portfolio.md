## Data Science Projects 
### [ClassifyMyMeds: Predicting Prior Authorization Approval and Volume for CoverMyMeds](https://github.com/hpieper14/classifymymeds) 

This project was sponsored by [CoverMyMeds](https://www.covermymeds.com) and was completed as a capstone project for [The Erdos Institute](https://www.erdosinstitute.org).  In this project, we survey many classifiers for predicting how likely a certain prior authorization (PA) claim will be approved, and forecast future volume of PA claims with time series analysis techniques. 

*Tools used*: classification, time series forecasting, uncertainty quantification

### [Solving PDEs Via Deep Neural Nets](https://github.com/hpieper14/PDEandNN)

This project uses deep neural networks to solve and identify the Swift-Hohenberg equation; a fourth order stiff partial differential equation.

*Tools used*: deep learning
